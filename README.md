# Getting Started 

This is a React simple UI interface to retrieve metadata for [IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/), [BIA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/) and [SSBD](https://ssbd.riken.jp/) image data repositories.
The collected metadata is part of a database developed for foundingGIDE, a European Project which aims to increase the
interoperability of image data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
